## JargonWiki ##

JargonWiki is the actualization of a perceived need for an online compendium of jargon. Increasingly jargon has come to fill and even dominate the national discourse, and as such it was deemed useful to create a place where the ever more numerous and obscure pieces of linguistic conceit could be translated into plain English.

Originally, the idea was to create a dictionary of postmodern jargon in order to help those students suffering through modern education in the humanities, but it has been helpfully pointed out that this has already been done. Upon entree into the business world, it became clear to this site's original author that there was a vast sea of jargon out there, far more than enough to put the paltry amount bandied about with self-satisfied flair in the academy to bed for the night. Thus: JargonWiki.

### Project History ###

JargonWiki was founded in 2006 by Charles File to address a personal need for another doomed pet project to sink massive amounts of otherwise perfectly useful time into.
